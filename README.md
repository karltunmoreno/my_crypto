### About The Project
My_Crypto is an application to view and track cryptocurrency. A user will be able to use the homepage as a reference to the top 100 crypto prices. A user will have the ability to store their favorite cryptos and add the amount they have. Making it easy to track their value and their earnings. My_Crypto also has a crypto converter. The user can choose from a list of cryptos along with currencies and enter their amount of crypto to see what their crypto is worth in the currency they chose.

### Criteria

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
